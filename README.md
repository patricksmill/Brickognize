# Brickognize

A lightweight app I made to identify LEGO bricks using an iphone camera. It leverages the Brickognize api for the recognition logic and is mostly a barebones app surrounding the API. It has a local history tab where you can view previously scanned bricks.

Unlike most other brick recognition apps, Brickognize offers an unlimited amount of scans for free.
